                  <h3>Why is word count important?</h3>
                  <p>Whether it is for a website, a blog, an e-book or a corporate document, different types of writing requires a certain amount of word count length. Some platforms have limits as to how many words or letters can be used, for example, Google AdWords search ads or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image/facebook-feed/traffic" target="_blank">Facebook banner ads</a>.</p>
                  <p>Social media platforms are created for easy reading and quick consumption. Each platform has its own prescribed amount of viewable character count that can be posted. This is why knowing the character limits for social media platforms is important, especially if you are a digital marketer or social media manager.</p>
                  <p>If you are creating or managing social media content, it is useful to know the exact character limits for the platform you are working on. Here are the different character limits for popular social media platforms:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> - Up to 280 characters (increased from the previous 140 characters).</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> - No more than 63,206 characters for posts and a maximum of 8,000 characters for comments.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> - Limited to 30 hashtags and 2,200 characters for a caption (where only the first 125 characters will be displayed while the rest will be truncated).</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> - Headline text is limited to 120 characters, the summary section has a character limit of 2,000, position title has a limit of 100 characters, and the description box is limited to 1,000 characters.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Word count for SEO (and how it can improve your rankings)</h3>
                  <p>If you are writing for SEO, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/seo-user-science-behind-long-form-content-230721" target="_blank">word count plays an important role</a>. The majority of high ranking content that appears on page 1 on SERP are long-form articles. A lot of them exceed 2,000 words, while most of them are at least 1,500 words.</p>
                  <p>You will notice that a lot of long-form articles have evergreen content - the best type of content for SEO. <a href="https://moz.com/blog/the-true-power-of-evergreen-content-a-case-study" target="_blank">Evergreen content receives more clicks over a long period of time</a>, as opposed to content that is based on current news or viral trends.</p>
                  <p>Longer articles are also seen to be more authoritative. When you need to write longer content, you have the opportunity to insert more data and information into your article and make it more valuable.</p>
                  <p>As a result, your content will carry more value which increases the potential for the article being shared and linked to. The more social shares and backlinks you receive, the better your website or page rankings will be.</p>
                  <p>By using the Word Count Tool, you will be able to make sure that your article has the minimum amount of <a href="https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/06/05/5-proven-seo-benefits-long-form-content-marketers/" target="_blank">word count for SEO best practices</a>. Having an ideal number of word count will not guarantee good search rankings but it will surely help in the long run.</p>
